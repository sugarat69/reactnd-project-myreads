# Udacity - React Nanodegree - MyReads Project

This is my submission for the for the final project of the React Fundamentals course.

This application manages a collection of books using three categories or "shelves": _Currently Reading_, _Want to Read_ and _Read_. The user is able to move books between the three shelves. A search area is provided where new books can be added to the collection.

## Installation and Startup
